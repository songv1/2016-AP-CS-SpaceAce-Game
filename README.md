# SpaceAce
I teamed up with a friend to make a game based off Space Invaders. We submitted this as our final project for AP Computer Science (Java). Graphic resources were found on the internet.

We added our own touch to the game by programming the enemies to move along rosetta paths, having just learned about polar coordinates in Precalculus. 

# Credits

* Maya for working on this final project with me.
* Ms. Healey for teaching AP CS.
